This book-crossing app will help students to share their books with others and find something to themselves. It will be based on universities. In first we are going to deploy it in NSTU.  

We set ourselves a goal â€” to develop book trading in university campuses with the help of the mobile application. Main functionality will include adding and finding books. It will also have a personal feed that will suggest new books with your interests in mind that are defined upon registration.
